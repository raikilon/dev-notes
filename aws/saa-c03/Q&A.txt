 What is Multi-AZ RDS used for? What happens during a failover?; Multi-AZ RDS provides high availability by synchronously replicating data to a standby replica in another Availability Zone. If the primary database fails, the database CNAME is updated to point to the standby instance, which becomes the new primary, with some DNS-level delay.
 What is an Aurora Multi-AZ Cluster? How does it differ from traditional Multi-AZ RDS?; An Aurora Multi-AZ Cluster contains one writer instance that synchronously replicates to up to two reader instances in different AZs. Data is committed once at least one reader confirms the write. It offers read scaling via the reader endpoint and faster failover using transaction logs compared to traditional Multi-AZ RDS.

 What is IAM Authentication for RDS?; IAM Authentication for RDS allows you to map IAM identities to local RDS users and generates temporary 15-minute tokens for authentication instead of using static database credentials. However, authorization is still managed by the database engine.
 What is RDS Proxy and what problem does it solve?; RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy that sits between your application and your RDS database. It manages database connections, reducing resource consumption and latency, especially in serverless architectures with high connection volumes and short-lived functions like Lambda.
 What is AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) used for?; AWS DMS helps migrate databases between various source and target database engines, supporting both one-time full loads and continuous change data capture (CDC).
 What is AWS Aurora? How does its storage architecture differ from RDS?; AWS Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database service that combines the performance and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. Unlike RDS which uses EBS volumes per instance, Aurora uses a cluster volume that is shared by all instances in the cluster, with 6 copies of data across 3 AZs.
 What are Aurora Endpoints? What are the main types?; Aurora Endpoints provide connection points to the Aurora cluster. The main types are the Cluster Endpoint (points to the primary writer instance), the Reader Endpoint (load balances across read replicas), and Instance Endpoints (point to specific instances).
 What is Aurora Serverless? How is it billed?; Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, auto-scaling version of Aurora where you pay per second for database capacity consumed, measured in Aurora Capacity Units (ACUs). It can scale down to 0 ACUs when idle.
 What is Aurora Global Database?; Aurora Global Database allows for cross-region replication of an Aurora database with low latency (around 1 second), supporting disaster recovery and low-latency reads for global users. It has one primary region and up to 5 secondary read-only regions (16 replicas total).
 What is Multi-Master Writes in Aurora?; Multi-Master Aurora is a configuration that allows all instances in the Aurora cluster to perform both read and write operations, unlike standard Aurora with a single writer. Applications connect to specific instances instead of a cluster endpoint.
 What is Amazon DynamoDB? What type of database is it?; Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that supports key-value and document data models. It offers automatic scaling, high availability, and fast performance.
 What are the two types of primary keys in DynamoDB?; The two types of primary keys in DynamoDB are a partition key (simple primary key) and a composite primary key consisting of a partition key and a sort key.
 What are RCUs and WCUs in DynamoDB? What do they measure?; RCUs (Read Capacity Units) measure the read throughput capacity of a DynamoDB table (1 RCU = 1 strongly consistent read of up to 4KB or 2 eventually consistent reads of up to 4KB per second). WCUs (Write Capacity Units) measure the write throughput capacity (1 WCU = 1 write of up to 1KB per second). You specify these for provisioned capacity mode.
 What is the difference between a Query and a Scan operation in DynamoDB?; A Query in DynamoDB retrieves items based on the partition key value and optionally a sort key condition, making it efficient for targeted data retrieval. A Scan examines every item in the table, which is less efficient and more costly.
 What are the two types of read consistency available in DynamoDB? What are their trade-offs?; The two types of read consistency in DynamoDB are Eventually Consistent Reads (data might not reflect the most recent writes but are less expensive) and Strongly Consistent Reads (always reflect the latest writes but are more expensive and less scalable).
 What are Local Secondary Indexes (LSIs) in DynamoDB? What are their limitations?; Local Secondary Indexes (LSIs) in DynamoDB provide an alternative sort key for a given partition key. They must be created when the table is created, have the same partition key as the base table, and share the base table's RCU/WCU. A table can have a maximum of 5 LSIs.
 What are Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) in DynamoDB? How do they differ from LSIs?; Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) in DynamoDB provide an alternative partition key and sort key for querying a table. They can be created at any time, have their own RCU/WCU allocations, and the data in GSIs is eventually consistent. A table can have a maximum of 20 GSIs.
 What are DynamoDB Streams used for?; DynamoDB Streams capture a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in a DynamoDB table with a rolling 24-hour window. They can trigger AWS Lambda functions for event-driven architectures.
 What are DynamoDB Global Tables?; DynamoDB Global Tables provide multi-master cross-region replication, allowing you to create DynamoDB tables in multiple AWS regions and have the data automatically replicated between them with sub-second latency. They use a "last writer wins" conflict resolution strategy. Reads across regions are eventually consistent.
 What is DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)?; DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available in-memory cache for DynamoDB that can reduce read latencies from milliseconds to microseconds and decrease the read cost of your DynamoDB tables by offloading requests. It is deployed within a VPC across multiple AZs.
 What is TTL (Time to Live) in DynamoDB?; TTL (Time to Live) in DynamoDB allows you to define a per-item attribute that specifies when an item should be automatically deleted. This background process is free and does not impact table performance.
 What is Amazon ElastiCache? What are the two supported engines?; Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory data store service that provides low-latency, high-performance caching to improve application responsiveness and reduce database load. It supports Redis and Memcached engines.
 What are some key differences between Redis and Memcached in ElastiCache?; Redis supports complex data structures, Multi-AZ with replication, and backup/restore. Memcached supports simple string data, multiple nodes for sharing without true replication, and no built-in backup/restore.
 What is Amazon Redshift? What type of database is it optimized for?; Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. It is optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads using column-based storage. It is not serverless and runs in a single AZ within a VPC.
 What is Amazon Athena? What type of data source is it primarily used with?; Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It uses a schema-on-read approach.
 What is Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)? What is a key concept in SNS?; Amazon SNS is a public AWS service for sending notifications from publishers to subscribers. A key concept is an SNS Topic, which acts as a logical access point and communication channel. SNS is region-resilient. Messages have a maximum payload of 256KB.
 What is Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)? What are the two queue types?; Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It is region-resilient. The two queue types are Standard Queue (at least once delivery, best-effort ordering) and FIFO Queue (exactly once delivery, ordered messages). Messages have a maximum size of 256KB.
 What is a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) in the context of SQS?; A Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is an SQS queue used to store messages that could not be processed successfully by consumer applications after a certain number of attempts (tracked by `ReceiveCount`).
 What is the difference between Delay Queue and Visibility Timeout in SQS?; A Delay Queue postpones the delivery of new messages to consumers for a specified period (up to 15 minutes, not in FIFO). Visibility Timeout hides a message after it's received by a consumer, preventing other consumers from processing it concurrently until the timeout expires (default 30 seconds, max 12 hours).
 What is the relationship between CloudWatch Events and Amazon EventBridge?; Amazon EventBridge is the next evolution of CloudWatch Events. While both observe events and trigger actions, EventBridge offers more features like the ability to create multiple event buses (including partner event buses) and supports API destinations. AWS is moving towards EventBridge as the preferred event service.
 In what scenarios should you use EventBridge, SNS, and SQS?; Use EventBridge for routing and filtering structured events between AWS services, applications, and SaaS. Use SNS for real-time push notifications to multiple subscribers. Use SQS for message queuing to decouple components and ensure reliable asynchronous processing.
 When should you consider using Amazon MQ instead of SQS or SNS for messaging?; You should consider using Amazon MQ if you are migrating existing applications from on-premises message brokers like RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ and need to maintain compatibility with standard messaging protocols like AMQP, MQTT, STOMP, OpenWire, or WebSocket. New AWS implementations should generally prefer SNS/SQS due to native integration and easier scaling.
 What is Amazon Kinesis? What is a fundamental scaling unit in Kinesis Streams?; Amazon Kinesis is a real-time, scalable streaming service for ingesting and processing large streams of data. The fundamental scaling unit in Kinesis Streams is a shard. 1 shard provides 1MB/s ingestion and 2MB/s consumption.
 How does Kinesis Data Firehose differ from Kinesis Data Streams?; Kinesis Data Firehose is a near real-time, fully managed, serverless, and auto-scaling service for delivering streaming data to destinations like S3, Redshift, Splunk, and HTTP endpoints. It has higher latency (around 60s) than Kinesis Data Streams and does not store data persistently, only buffers it. It also does not support multiple consumers like Kinesis Streams.
 What is AWS Glue? What is its primary function?; AWS Glue is a serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service for processing and moving data between different data sources and destinations. Its primary function is to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It uses Crawlers to auto-discover data and creates a centralized AWS Glue Data Catalog.
 What is the purpose of the AWS Glue Data Catalog?; The AWS Glue Data Catalog is a persistent metadata store for multiple data sources, providing a centralized repository to avoid data silos and ensure a single source of truth for data used by AWS analytics services like Athena, Redshift Spectrum, and EMR.
 What is AWS CloudFormation? What is a key concept in CloudFormation?; AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that allows you to define and provision AWS infrastructure using YAML or JSON templates. A key concept is a Stack, which represents a collection of AWS resources that are managed as a single unit.
 What are CloudFormation Parameters?; CloudFormation Parameters allow you to input values when you create or update a stack, making your templates more flexible and reusable.
 What are CloudFormation Intrinsic Functions? Give an example.; CloudFormation Intrinsic Functions are built-in functions that help you retrieve information or apply conditions within your templates. Examples include `Ref` to get the value of a parameter or resource, and `Fn::GetAtt` to retrieve a specific attribute of a resource.
 What are CloudFormation Mappings?; CloudFormation Mappings are key-value pairs that you can define in your template to create a lookup table for setting resource properties based on input parameters or conditions (e.g., mapping region and architecture to an AMI ID using `!FindInMap`).
 What are CloudFormation Outputs used for?; CloudFormation Outputs declare values that are returned when you describe a stack. They can be viewed in the AWS Management Console or via the AWS CLI, and can be exported for use in other CloudFormation stacks as cross-stack references.
 What are CloudFormation Conditions used for?; CloudFormation Conditions allow you to control whether certain resources are created or properties are set based on the evaluation of a logical expression (e.g., creating a specific type of EC2 instance only in a production environment).
 What is the DependsOn attribute in CloudFormation? When is it necessary?; The DependsOn attribute in CloudFormation allows you to explicitly specify that the creation of one resource should follow the creation of another resource. It is necessary when implicit dependencies (based on references in resource definitions) are not sufficient to ensure the correct order of resource creation, especially for resources that might not directly reference each other but have a sequential dependency.
 What is cfn-signal used for in CloudFormation?; cfn-signal is a helper script used in conjunction with CreationPolicy or WaitConditions to signal to CloudFormation that a resource (typically an EC2 instance or Auto Scaling group) has been successfully created and configured. It holds the stack creation process until the required number of success signals are received or a timeout occurs, allowing CloudFormation to detect and roll back failed deployments.
 What are CloudFormation Nested Stacks? When should you use them?; CloudFormation Nested Stacks allow you to manage stacks as components of other stacks, creating a hierarchy of stacks. You should use them when you need to reuse the same template logic across different parts of your infrastructure and when the lifecycle of the child stacks is tightly linked to the parent stack.
 What are CloudFormation Cross-Stack References? How are outputs shared between stacks?; CloudFormation Cross-Stack References allow you to reference output values from one CloudFormation stack in another stack. To share outputs, you must export them from the source stack with a unique name (per region), and then import them in the referencing stack using the `Fn::ImportValue` intrinsic function. This is useful when stacks have different lifecycles and you need to reuse specific resources.
 What are CloudFormation StackSets?; CloudFormation StackSets allow you to deploy and manage stacks across multiple AWS accounts and regions with a single operation, without needing to individually manage each account and region.
 What is the DeletionPolicy attribute in CloudFormation? What are the common options?; The DeletionPolicy attribute in CloudFormation specifies what happens to a physical resource when its corresponding logical resource is removed from a CloudFormation template and the stack is updated. Common options are Delete (default, the resource is deleted), Retain (the resource is kept), and Snapshot (a snapshot is created before deletion, if supported by the resource, e.g., for EBS and RDS).
 What are CloudFormation Stack Roles? Why are they a best practice?; CloudFormation Stack Roles allow CloudFormation to assume a specific IAM role when creating and managing resources in a stack, instead of using the permissions of the user who created the stack. This is a best practice for enforcing role separation and granting CloudFormation only the necessary permissions to manage the stack's resources, rather than requiring broad permissions for the stack creator.
 What is CloudWatch primarily used for in AWS?; CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects and manages operational data in the form of metrics, logs, and events, providing insights into the performance and health of your AWS resources and applications.
 What are CloudWatch Metrics? What are some key components of a metric?; CloudWatch Metrics are time-ordered sets of data points that represent the performance of your AWS resources and applications. Key components include a namespace (e.g., AWS/EC2), metric name (e.g., CPUUtilization), dimensions (key-value pairs that provide context to the metric, e.g., InstanceId), and unit (e.g., percent).
 What are CloudWatch Logs used for? What are the key components of CloudWatch Logs?; CloudWatch Logs allows you to monitor, store, and access your log files from EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and other AWS services in a highly scalable and durable manner. Key components include Log Groups (collections of log streams) and Log Streams (sequences of log events from a single source).
 What are CloudWatch Alarms? What are the possible states of an alarm?; CloudWatch Alarms allow you to monitor CloudWatch metrics and trigger actions when the metric breaches a specified threshold for a defined period. The possible states of an alarm are OK, Alarm, and Insufficient Data.
 What is AWS CloudTrail? What types of events does it record?; AWS CloudTrail is a service that provides auditing and governance by recording API calls and activities made in your AWS account. It records two types of events: Management Events (control plane operations, tracked by default) and Data Events (operations on resources like S3 objects or Lambda invocations, must be explicitly enabled).
 Where can CloudTrail logs be stored? Is CloudTrail real-time?; CloudTrail logs can be stored in Amazon S3 (recommended for cost-effectiveness) or CloudWatch Logs. CloudTrail is not real-time; there is typically a delay (around 15 minutes) in event delivery.
 What is AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store used for? What are the different parameter types?; AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store provides a centralized, encrypted store to manage configuration data, passwords, database strings, license codes, and other sensitive information. Parameter types include String (plain text), String list, and SecureString (encrypted using KMS). It is a public service.
 What is AWS Secrets Manager? How does it differ from Parameter Store?; AWS Secrets Manager is specifically designed for storing and managing secrets, offering features like automatic rotation of secrets (using Lambda functions) and integration with AWS services like RDS for automatic credential updates upon rotation. All secrets are encrypted with KMS. While Parameter Store can also store sensitive data, Secrets Manager provides more advanced secret management capabilities.
